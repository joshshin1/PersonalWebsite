            Why Computer Science and Mathematics
        </h1>
        <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 150%; color: white; padding: 0% 15% 5% 15%; opacity: .5;">
            I fell in love with computer science when I was 14 years old. Fresh out of middle school, I began my first computer science class in high school and was introduced to Java and HTML. Since that first class freshman year,
            there has not been a single year that I was not in a computer science class or coding in my free time. After sophomore year, I had completed the computer science curriculum offered at my high school and continued to take independent studies.
            In the latter two years, I was able to bring an old board game, four player chess, to life through java and created my own drawing software. However, when I applied to universities, I applied as a biology major.
            All my life, my parents had pushed me to be a doctor, so naturally, I wanted to be a doctor. My motivation fizzled and my beliefs quickly changed after I took my first biology class. Computer science had always been my passion,
            so against my parents wishes, I applied to transfer into computer science. That decision was the best decision of my life. Since then, I have enjoyed every class and even decided to pursue a double major in mathematics.
            Since day one, math had been a passion of mine, so I thought, "Why not?". Now, my workload is much larger than the average student, but I cherish every second of it. Expanding my knowledge brings me joy, and now, I am able to learn what I love every day.

            <p>
                I am a proud member of the Texas A&M Competitive Climbing Team! With 40 members total, our climbing team competes against other colleges
                in the official Collegiate USA Climbing division. There 2 main categories of climbing that we compete in: rope climbing and bouldering.
                Personally, I enjoy the freedom bouldering offers compared to rope climbing, so you can almost always catch me at our bouldering wall during the week.
                In 2019, we stole the title of regional champions from UT, our biggest rival. With COVID less of a concern this year, I have high hopes that we will be able to do the same this year!

            My Vision for the Future

            I harbor a special appreciation for everything related to computer science, but however, my true passion lies in research and development. My goal is work for a hedge fund out of college. Specifically, I would like to work for Jane Street Capital, Two Sigma, or Citadel.
            After I gain experience in the industry and enjoy my younger years, I hope to be able to return to school and earn a PhD in mathematics or machine learning. With a PhD, my dream is to push the boundaries of what is possible and innovate the world in a way nobody thinks is possible.
            To do that, I plan on becoming a professor and conducting research at a university. I am a dreamer and I believe that anything is possible with enough determination. However, that amount of determination is unknown. I can only hope that I have what it takes to carry out my vision.

            <p>
                Also known as ACE, the Aggie Club of Engineers is a professional mens organization at Texas A&M University.
                I was inducted into the club in 2020 and have grown socially and professionally since joining. ACE is a social/service/professional organization that contributes to service events around campus such as
                street cleanup, TAMU Build, Songfest, and many more. In addition to those events, we also donate to <a href="https://ptsdusa.org/camp-hope/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Camp Hope</a>
                , a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping veterans suffering from PTSD. Also a professional organization, ACE hosts meet and greets with recruiters from companies as well as seminars with alumni working in the industry.
                All things considered, becoming a part of ACE has been and will continue to be a highlight of my time at Texas A&M.
